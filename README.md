# COMP229-Assignment02 - Express Portfolio Website
Welcome to my portfolio site built using the Express framework and Node.js!
Some cool stuff to notice in code:
1. The project uses the MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller)
2. Route guards are in place for the Business Contacts page (To prevent unauthorized users from viewing that page)

The website is hosted at [Express Portfolio](https://comp229-assignment02.herokuapp.com/)
